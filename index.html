        <p>For years now, I have enjoyed a piping hot bowl of oatmeal for breakfast almost every single morning. <br><br>
  Breakfast has been my favorite meal of the day for as long as I can remember. Pancakes, waffles, peanut butter toast, tofu scramble, and avocado toast are some of my current favorite foods to eat in the morning. <br><br>
  But for some reason, I always seem to get bored of these options and revert back to my tried and true — oatmeal. I love to cook my oatmeal in a variety of ways including in the microwave, on the stovetop, and I even enjoy the no-bake option of making overnight oats in the refrigerator. <br><br>
  Recently though, I have been loving making baked oatmeal in the oven. I’m definitely not the only one. Baked oatmeal recipes have been going viral on food blogs and social platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, especially in recent months. <br><br>
  The following are a few key reasons you might want to ditch the microwave and stovetop this week and try making baked oats instead.</p>

        <h2>It tastes like eating cate for breakfast.</h2>
        <p>I cannot stress enough here how fluffy baked oats turn out in comparison to their microwaved counterparts. <br><br>
  In order to make baked oats, you first turn the oats into a “batter” by combining them with water/almond milk and a few other key ingredients depending on the flavor you choose to make. Then, when you bake the mixture in the oven, it gets fluffy and cake-like. <br><br>
  Nothing beats eating oatmeal for breakfast that has a cake-like texture, with the added benefit of all the plant based nutrients contained in the oats. <br><br>
  The unique texture of baked oatmeal is the first key reason for taking the extra time to cook it in this manner.</p>

        <h2>2. It is surprisingly budget friendly.</h2>
          <p>Unlike some breakfast options, baked oatmeal can be made for well under $1 per serving. Rolled oats in general are pretty inexpensive, and the other base ingredients for baked oats are typically water/almond milk and baking powder. <br><br>
  The other add-ins are customizable to your liking. I often opt for some of the following:</p> <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Frozen Blueberries</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Raspberries</li>
            <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
            <li>Nut Butter</li>
            <li>Chia Seeds</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these add-in options add flavor to your baked oatmeal, and they are pretty budget friendly as well. <br><br>
One of my personal favorite combinations is cocoa powder, nut butter, and chocolate chips. It tastes like chocolate cake, so it is the perfect little treat to end the night with. I filmed the recipe for my YouTube channel, which you can watch below:</p> <br><br>

        <h2>3. It is a nutrient packed dish.</h2>
        <p>No matter which flavor of baked oats you choose to make — blueberry, banana, strawberry chocolate chip, peanut butter banana, etc., you will end up with a super nutrient dense breakfast. <br><br>
This is because <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/oats#vitamins-and-minerals">oats are packed with vitamins and minerals like manganese, phosphorus, iron, zinc, and more.</a> You can rest assured that each time you make a delicious baked oatmeal recipe, you will be supplying your body with a plethora of essential micronutrients. <br><br>
When I began to make changes to my diet and lifestyle five years ago, one of the first things I did was swap out my daily bowl of sugar cereal for a hearty bowl of oatmeal. I honestly didn’t expect it to make much of a difference, but I felt immensely better within a few weeks of adopting this change. <br><br>
I can’t pinpoint exactly why this occurred, but I would guess it had something to do with the removal of all the added sugar in favor of a more natural, filling, plant based breakfast.<br><br>
It can be easy to convince yourself that small swaps won’t have much of an impact on your overall lifestyle. In reality, the small changes can act as catalysts for major improvements.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I love the ease of making quick oats in the microwave as much as the next person, but nothing beats eating a healthy breakfast that’s fluffy and cake-like. <br><br>
Baked oats provide a unique texture and flavor that you can’t achieve with the traditional microwave or stovetop method. <br><br>
So, the next time you want to switch things up a bit, remember to give baked oatmeal a try. It just might become your new favorite breakfast.</p> <br><br>
